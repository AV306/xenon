# Xenon Feature Documentation

All are open for suggestions and PRs!

## Blocks

## Chat
- QuickChat - Send a custom message at the push of a button
- MultiQuickChat - Send a custom message at the push of two buttons (feature key+ number key)
- ShareLocation - Send a chat message with your current location and dimension, still at the push of a button (WIP: /whisper support for public servers)

## Movement
- Timer - Speed up your actions! Technically classified as a hack, but is still extremely useful.

## Render
- Australian Mode - Simulate Australian Minecraft (upside down)
- FullBright - Full gamma, making every surface clearly visible without loghting effects (incompatible with shaders)
- ProximityRadar - Outlines nearby players and hostile mobs, through walls (commonly known as ESP)
- Take Panorama - Quickly generate panoramas that can be used in a custom title screen panorama resource pack
- Zoom - Look at far-away objects, with adjustable zoom. Compatible with Australian Mode!

## Misc
- CommandProcessor - Enable/disable features, change their configs, get help and run macros, all from the chat! (Note: up/down previous message access broken as of 1.19+)
- ConfigMenu - Change feature configs (Sometimes works, sometimes doesnt; broken as of 1.19.4 due to a CompleteConfig issue)
- FeatureList - Lists the features you have enabled
- LazyDFU Integration - Optimises DFU (DataFixerUpper) just like LazyDFU

## Interactions (coming soon)
- FriendList - A way to mark certain players as "friends", for use with features like ProximityRadar and (Multi)QuickChat
