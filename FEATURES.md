Send one of 10 custom message at the push of two buttons - the feature key and a number key

**ShareLocation**

Send a chat message with your current location and dimension, also at the push of a button. (WIP: /whisper support for public servers)

### Movement

**Timer**

Speed up your actions! May be considered a hack on some servers, but still genuinely useful where it is allowed. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK; server opt-out available

**FullKeyboard**

Disclaimer: Touchscreen still required for some UI interaction (ugh); MidnightControls is *much* better.
