# Xenon Feature Documentation

All are open for suggestions and PRs!

## Chat
- QuickChat - Send a custom message at the push of a button (commands will be sent as a chat message, fix for that WIP)
- MultiQuickChat - Send a custom message at the push of two buttons (feature key + number key)
- ShareLocation - Send a chat message with your current location and dimension, still at the push of a button (WIP: /whisper support for public servers)

## Movement
- Timer - Speed up your actions! Not allowed on some servers, but still genuinely useful where it is allowed. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK; server opt-out available

## Render
- Australian Mode - Simulate Australian Minecraft (upside down)
- FullBright - Full gamma, making every surface clearly visible without lighting effects (incompatible with most shaders)
- ProximityRadar - Outlines nearby players and hostile mobs, through walls (Server opt-out available)
- WAILA - Sub-par WAILA implementation; you're better off using another mod like WTHIT. This is just here for fun.
- HealthDisplay - Shows mobs' health in their nameplates (the name text above their head)
- Take Panorama - Quickly generate panoramas that can be used in a custom title screen panorama resource pack
- Zoom - Look at far-away objects, with adjustable zoom. Compatible with Australian Mode!

## Misc
- BlackBox - Records information like your position, health and death point(s) as you play. A Flight Data Recorder for Minecraft!
- CommandProcessor - Enable/disable features, change their configs, get help and run macros, all from the chat. (Note: up/down previous message access broken as of 1.19+)
- ConfigMenu - Change feature configs (Sometimes works, sometimes doesn't, sorry)
- FeatureList - Lists the features you have enabled
- LazyDFU Integration - Optimises DFU (DataFixerUpper) just like LazyDFU
