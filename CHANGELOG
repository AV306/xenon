=====

3.1.0
    Added a "full keyboard gameplay" feature: Allows you to play Minecraft using only your keyboard and a touchscreen. Full mouse event simulation (so you can drop the touchscreen) is in progress, but not very successful
    Added missing translation keys
    Fixed a bug in CommandProcessor where it would crash if the command is missing the action keyword
    Fixed a bug where the shader color was not reset in ProximityRadar and RedReticle, causing the hotbar to be miscolored

3.1.1
    Fixed a typo in the FKB "look right" translation key
    Implemented server-side feature-restriction via chat messages (so all servers can do it)
