# Ethics Guidelines

This file contains guidelines on the types of features that should and should *not* be added to Xenon.

## The Purpose of Xenon

Xenon was originally created to be a simple "utility" clientmod. It was designed to serve the following purposes:

To **enhance** Vanilla gameplay by providing **information displays** (e.g. DataHUD,
to replace OptiFine's FPS display while OptiFabric updated), **convenient shortcuts** to **existing features** (e.g. FullBright,
which can be achieved simply by modifying options.txt, QuickChat).

It is *not* meant to facilitate **cheating**, which will be defined as "having an **unfair advantage** over Vanilla players,
through the **modification** of the game".
