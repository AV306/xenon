# Xenon Client 

## Xenon 1.17.x is DEPRECATED.

You shouldn't be playing Minecraft 1.17, 1.18 is way better.

This branch is also *very* behind 1.18 (main).

## Setup

For setup instructions please see the [fabric wiki page](https://fabricmc.net/wiki/tutorial:setup) that relates to the IDE that you are using.

## Features

- Toggled Fullbright
- Client commands (WIP, struggling)
- Stupid test GUI (WIP, struggling even more)
- Autoreply (Additional components available when commands are finished)
- Nuker (WIP, have to wait for event bus which underlies literally everything else here)
