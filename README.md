Hello! This is Xenon, a Minecraft utility mod that adds stuff like Fullbright and WAILA functionality to Minecraft.

This is good for people who want the features of clients such as Badlion or Lunar, but want it to be compatible with other mods.

NOTE: Once a new Minecraft version is released, support for previous versions tends to be dropped due to my bad version control habits.

## Requirements:

- Fabric Loader >= 0.13.3 (Recommended: 0.13.3 Just use the latest version, it's better that way)
- Fabric API for that version (Recommended: 0.51.0+1.18.2)

## Incompatible mods:

- TODO

## Features:

(All are unbound by default)
~~Maybe someday I'll implement multi-key seqnences~~
- FullBright 
- QuickChat
- Bad WAILA implementation (use WTHIT instead)
- Panorama Generator (I'm proud of this one)
- ShareLocation
- NoFireOverlay (useless, present in code but not accessible, exists for initial testing purposes)
- FeatureList (not really a feature)
- DataHUD (useless)
- Configuration system
- ProximityRadar
- Timer (*wheee*)
- FastBreak (Does not work *exactly* as intended, but close enough)
- Fundy Ice Physics (WIP)
- SpeedBoost (WIP)
- HighJump (WIP)
- AntiKnockback (WIP)
- modular and user-friendly feature creation/registration system I spent way too much time on

Planned features:

- AntiAFK
- QuickCommand
- FreeCam
