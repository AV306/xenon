Hello! This is Xenon, a Minecraft utility mod that adds stuff like Fullbright and WAILA functionality to Minecraft.

This is good for people who want the features of clients such as Badlion or Lunar, but want it to be compatible with other mods.

NOTE: Once a new Minecraft version is released, support for previous versions tends to be dropped due to my bad version control habits.

## Requirements:

- Fabric Loader >= 0.13.3 (Recommended: 0.13.3 Just use the latest version, it's better that way)
- Fabric API for that version (Recommended: 0.57.0+1.19)

## Incompatible mods:

- Nexus

## Features:

(All are unbound by default)

~~Maybe someday I'll implement multi-key seqnences~~
- FullBright 
- QuickChat
- Bad WAILA implementation (use WTHIT instead)
- Panorama Generator (I'm proud of this one)
- ShareLocation
- NoFireOverlay (useless, present in code but not accessible, exists for initial testing purposes)
- FeatureList (not really a feature)
- DataHUD (useless)
- Configuration system
- ProximityRadar
- Timer (*wheee*)
- FastBreak (Does not work *exactly* as intended, but close enough)
- Fundy Ice Physicsâ„¢ (WIP)
- SpeedBoost (WIP)
- HighJump
- AntiKnockback (WIP)
- modular and user-friendly feature creation/registration system I spent way too much time on
- Command processor and the beginnings of a macro system

Planned features:

- AntiAFK
- QuickCommand
- FreeCam

## Instructions for developers

### Setup

(If you just want to build the latest version, run ./scripts/\[os\]/export; e.g. ./scripts/nix/export for Linux/MacOS)

1. Install JDK 17 ~~or above~~ (Minecraft's bundled JRE is version 17, and it won't work if you compile it with JDK 18)
2. Run ./gradlew eclipse if using Eclipse, otherwise IntelliJ *should* automatically set everything up.
3. Open the root folder as a project.
4. Done!

### Adding new features

1. Extend IFeature or IToggleableFeature depending on the type of feature.
2. Define a constructor and call `super( <name> );`, replacing `<name>` with the name of your feature.
3. Register event callbacks in the constructor, see `Timer` for an example. (Note: some features, like JumpBoost, that require  modifying the values of fields right before they are accessed, are more complex. Use `EventFields`, see `JumpBoost`.)
4. Register your feature by calling its constructor in `Xenon` (main class).






















why did i even spend a year of my life making this no one even cares about or notices, much less uses this stupid thing
