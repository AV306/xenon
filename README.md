Hello! This is Xenon, a Minecraft utility mod that adds useful stuff like Fullbright and AntiAFK functionality to Minecraft.

This is good for people who want the features of clients such as Badlion or Lunar, but want it to be compatible with other mods.

NOTE: Once a new Minecraft version is released, support for previous versions tends to be dropped due to my bad version control habits.

## Requirements:

- Fabric Loader >= 0.11.3
- Fabric API for that version

## Incompatible mods:

- Wurst Client (Keybinds)

## Features:

(All are mapped to -1 by default)
~~Maybe someday I'll implement multi-key seqnences~~
- FullBright 
- AutoResponse ( default text: ":")
- Debug GUI (WIP)
- ClickGUI (WIP)
- Panorama Generator
- ShareLocation
- NoFireOverlay
- \<Halo Red Reticle like thing\> (WIP)
- FeatureList (null)
- DataHUD (WIP)

Planned features:

- AntiAFK
- QuickCommand
- FreeCam
