/**
 * Xenon Feature Manager.
 * Does stuff like have a BiMap for conversion of Feature name strings to classes.
 * Also maintains an ArrayList of enabled features.
 * Exposes most of these through instance methods and fields.
 *
 * Why am I wasting my life writing long docstrings?
 * No one besides me is ever gonna look at this anyway.
 * What's the point of all this?
 * Why do I spend hours on end, trying to figure out
 * how to implement and optimise stuff in this?
 * 
 * Anyways, have fun with this class, future self!
