# General Contributing Guidelines

- Don't make gigantic commits. (e.g. 200 line code dump). Make multiple small commits* and push them together, but don't push each one individually (been there, done that)
- Make sure that all features only cause a minor drop in FPS. See WailaFeature for an example of optimisations.
- No hacks ("illegal features") please, only "legal" and "grey" features e.g. WAILA, AntiAFK
- Comment and document code. Please.
- Ignore any prompts to merge branches for previous Minecraft versions into the main branch.

\* Please try to write meaningful yet succint commit messages, like those in the [Linux kernel repo](https://github.com/torvalds/linux), and not either single characters "æ˜¯", keysmashes or weird ones like "patch patch patch patch". (All real examples from me)
