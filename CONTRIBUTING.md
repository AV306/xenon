# General Contributing Guidelines

- Try not to make gigantic commits. (e.g. 200 line code dump); multiple small commits pushed together are recommended
- Make sure that all features only cause a minor drop in FPS. See WailaFeature for an example of optimisations.
- No hacks ("illegal features") please (Modrinth Content Rules), only "legal" and "grey" features e.g. WAILA
- Comment and document code. Please :(
- Ignore any prompts to merge branches for previous Minecraft versions into the main branch
