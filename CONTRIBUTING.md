# General Contributing Guidelines

- Don't make gigantic commits. (e.g. 200 line code dump). Make multiple small commits (witn messages that aren't like "a"?) and push them together, but don't push each one individually (been there, done that)
- Make sure that all features only cause a minor drop in FPS. See WailaFeature for an example of optimisations.
- No hacks ("illegal features") please, only "legal" and "grey" features e.g. WAILA, AntiAFK
- Comment code. Please.
- Ignore any prompts to merge branches for previous Minecraft versions into the main branch.
