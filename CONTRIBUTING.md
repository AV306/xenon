# General Comtributing Guidelines

- Don't make gigantic commits. (e.g. 200 line code dump). Make multiple small commits and push them together, but don't push each one individually (been there, done that)
- Make sure that all features only cause an almost unnoticable drop in FPS. See WailaFeature for an example of optimisations,
- No hacks ("illegal features") please, only "legal" and "grey" features e.g. WAILA, AntiAFK
- Comment code. Please.
